	Ideas: Tap into an API that tracks comments/opinions/quotes of what other traders in the market are doing.  This would be in real-time and you could search for any particular stock such as AAPL or GOOG or INTC, etc. 

	Add an interactive map that shows where the comments are coming from. 

	Add something that allows you to see what trades institutional traders are currently making (or have made recently) to quickly give insight on where the market may be headed or so the novices can get insight on what the pros are trading.
