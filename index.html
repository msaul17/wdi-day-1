        Someone will always tell you you're doing it wrong.  I liked that the author pointed out that there are multiple ways of doing things
        and that while there may be a preferred way to do something, your way may not be wrong.

        Don't waste your time worrying about "greek cred." It's a waste of time and energy to worry about your clothing, presentation, and choice of reading material. Your energy is much better spend in builing something instead of worrying how your fit into the various greek subcultures.

        Sticking with it is more important than the method. I like it how the author talks about hitting a steep curve where things get difficult quickly. This is definitely been true for me. I'm looking forward to sticking with it and learing to code!
